# Reflections on the Course and the Website Creation Process

There exists an overwhelming amount of academic writing on dystopian literature, however, the same cannot be said for utopian (or simply just hopeful) literature. As the science fiction genre has gained immense popularity, both among consumers of popular culture - readers, viewers, video game players etc. - as well as among academics researching science fiction texts or phenomena, a trend has appeared in terms of what kinds of science fiction stories are produced, popularised, and academically analysed. The scene is overwhelmingly dominated by dystopian narratives and story-worlds. 

W. J. Gilliam describes this development as follows: 'In the last century, science fiction has become an incredibly powerful tool in depicting alternative social imaginaries, particularly those of the future. Extending beyond their fictious nature is a commentary on the stark realities of modern society.' (1) 

As Gilliam mentions, science fiction as a genre concerns itself with alternative - often future - imaginaries, however, thus far, both the most popular and the most researched narratives have concerned themselves with dystopian futures. As interesting at these dystopian versions of society may be, they are more often than not either commentary on the current state of society or narratives examining the fears that stem from a world that feels like it is moving in a concerning direction - be it in terms of climate change, the rise of extremist ideology, or something else. 

However, just as science fiction narratives can imagine worse futures and interrogate the fears which permeate our current society, science fiction can likewise imagine better futures and seek out reasons for hope.

The emerging field of utopian and/or solarpunk studies seeks to create a deeper understanding of what this more hopeful version of science fiction storytelling can contribute to society. Like all other science fiction writing, solarpunk literature ‘can lead minds through the imaginative exploration of the jungle of political, social, psychological, and ethical issues' (Paul & Alan 2851). In addition to this, much solarpunk writing and media - be it fictional or theoretical - has a clear connection to ecocriticism, climate activism, and posthumanism: ‘As a social imaginary, solarpunk can provide guiding principles to direct activism and governance towards building a better future for humanity and the Earth.’ (Gilliam 3)
