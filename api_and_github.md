# APIs and GitHub
 
## Introduction
 
Knowledge of APIs and GitHub can greatly ease the process of software development. Understanding the functionality of APIs opens up new possibilities for what a website or application can be as the list of existing APIs that can be implemented is long and diverse. GitHub provides a platform through which to access open-source APIs, but the website is also a general hub for other open-source software. GitHub allows for large scale digital collaboration, allowing users to copy and modify each other’s code, reshaping existing code to fit their specific needs. This paper will cover the general definition of what an API is and how APIs may be useful in the context of academic research, specifically in the field of English Literature studies. The second part of the paper will discuss the use and benefits of GitHub and open-source technology, both in academic research as well as in the classroom.

  
## What is an API and How can APIs Aid the Process of Literary Research?
 
An Application Programming Interface or an API is an interface that ‘enable[s] different software systems to communicate and exchange data seamlessly, acting as intermediaries between various applications’ (Akintoye 3). In more basic terms, an API enables two different pieces of software to communicate and exchange data, which makes app development easier, as developers can integrate an existing API instead of having to code the function or create a database from scratch (Akintoye 3). APIs can also improve user experience as they facilitate cross-platform integration and communication by allowing access to data from one application through another application. 
 
As an English major focusing my academic studies on English literature, programmes like Voyant Tools are often useful in aiding preliminary analysis of large amounts of text – so called ‘distant reading’ as laid out by Franco Moretti in his article ‘Conjectures on World Literature’. While Voyant provides access to different corpora (particularly ones containing the works of canonical authors such as Jane Austen and William Shakespeare), the platform is somewhat lacking when it comes to easy analysis of non-canonical and customizable bodies of work and here is where I see the use for implementation of an API that would establish a connection between Voyant and their users’ personal eBook libraries, through existing eBook libraries like Google Books or Amazon Kindle. 
 
Such an API would allow users to access their personal eBook libraries and through that access, analyse purchased books with the tools provided by Voyant. This would in many ways be useful in the academic research I am currently conducting for my master’s thesis where I am surveying the existing literature within the genre of solarpunk. The genre is still quite new and thus remains under-researched. The genre is in the process of defining itself which also means that it is quite an unstable genre, lacking any clear, single definition. Accessing key solarpunk anthologies and novels and analysing them through Voyant would be a useful place to begin an analysis of the genre as Voyant can illustrate common themes across the entire, chosen corpus. This kind of analysis then has the potential to inspire different paths for further inquiry.

Another point where an integration of Google Books or Amazon Kindle into Voyant could aid in literary analysis would be to compare generic themes between for instance solarpunk and dystopian fiction. Solarpunk as a genre stands in opposition to dystopian fiction and claims to be optimistic at its foundation (Więckowska 356). This claim could be tested by running several dystopian novels and several solarpunk novels through Voyant in order to analyse whether solarpunk novels do indeed use more positive and optimist language than dystopian novels. Doing this by directly accessing eBooks from Amazon Kindle or Google Books through Voyant would be far more efficient than having to obtain all desired materials as PDFs for manual upload.
 
The APIs I have mentioned here do not quite exist in the exact form I imagine. Google Books does have an API; however, it does not provide access to specific user libraries but rather allows access to search through the complete Google Books library in order to see information about their books such as metadata and price (Overview | Google Books APIs). Likewise, as far as I could gather Amazon does not offer a Kindle API with the functionality I theorise above. There is possibly an issue of intellectual property rights that would make it difficult to create and implement such an API in an ethical or legal way.

 
## GitHub and Open-Source Technology
  
GitHub is ‘a hugely popular website for collaborative work on software code’ (Perkel 127). GitHub relies on the software tool Git, and it is the website’s ability to provide a user-friendly interface for Git that lies at the foundation of the site’s popularity (Perkel 128). Git allows for systematic version control which is what enables GitHub to be the collaborative platform that it is. The systematic version control opens up for the possibility of having several different contributors to a project without contributors unintentionally overriding each other’s works because it keeps track every file version – every change made – as separate instances. This makes GitHub a ‘democratic system’, a digital collaborative workshop (Perkel 128). GitHub further encourages collaboration and innovation through the ability of users to copy or ‘fork’ existing repositories and thereby continue developing those repositories in the direction they personally need – allowing users to stand on the shoulders of the people who came before in order to adapt existing code, programmes, APIs etc. to new contexts. 
 
GitHub is a digital platform for open-source software code development, and by encouraging open-source development, GitHub democratises access to many different types of codes and programmes. The usefulness of GitHub also extends to academic contexts, both in teaching and research. Jeffrey Perkel presents a case where GitHub facilitated international collaboration on a research project that sought to model the spread of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa (127). What started as a single PhD student’s repository, where she daily updated data on the spread of Ebola, became a collaborative effort, allowing ‘third parties [to] download and convert the [health] ministries’ data before her, and load them into the GitHub repository’ (Perkel 127).
 
Likewise, GitHub is also useful as a digital collaborative workspace for university students. Beshero-Bondar and Parker describe how a collective GitHub workspace (or ‘garage’) helped their digital humanities students gain familiarity with GitHub, basic file management protocol, and several computational tools (259-260). In their experience, GitHub both provided an environment in which students could learn to develop their own ideas, but the repository also functioned as a connection point for peer-feedback, allowing students to ask questions and help each other with their projects (262).

 
## Conclusion
 
For people studying or working within the fields of the humanities, simply knowing that APIs exist and what their function is, is useful. With this knowledge comes an awareness of what is possible in terms of website or application functionality, which, in our digital age, is useful regardless of your field of work as we are constantly interacting with these types of programmes. Websites or apps are also often key parts of brand or knowledge communication and thus knowing all the options open to you when outlining a website is a clear benefit. GitHub, as a platform for sharing and collaborating on open-source software, grants access to a diverse range of APIs and other software. By providing easy access to systematic version control through Git, the platform makes it easy for users to rework, adapt or simply directly implement other people’s code thus encouraging large-scale collaboration and innovation. This democratic, digital workspace is useful, not only for dedicated software developers, but also for researchers, teachers, and beyond.
