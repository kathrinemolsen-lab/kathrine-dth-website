# Digital Humanities in English

## Introduction

As the world has steadily become increasingly digitised, the field of digital humanities has ‘exploded into academic consciousness as the Next Big Thing’ (Kopec 333). However, it can be argued that the concept of a singular ‘field’ of digital humanities does not actually exist (Eve 3). More accurately, then, digital humanities can be thought of as a methodological approach which can be applied within the different fields of the humanities (Kopec 331). The methodological approach offered by digital humanities also creates possibilities for interdisciplinary applications, creating a point of contact or synthesis between different fields of humanities research (Eve 3). Within the field of English literature studies, the digital humanities offer tools such as ‘text analysis, data visualization, digital mapping, archival digitization’ and much more (Thakre 17). This paper seeks to present the different possibilities that implementation of digital technology methods within the field of English literature studies can offer while also considering some of the challenges these methods might bring with them.

## Possibilities for the Use of Digital Technologies in the Field of English Literature

The use of digital methods in the study of English literature has deeper roots than some may expect. Reaching all the way back to calls for quantitative analyses of literature in 1923 and modules on ‘Literary Analysis by Computer’ at Dartmouth College in the 1960s, attempts to merge literary analysis with digital and quantitative methods are far from exclusive to the 21st century (Eve 5). However, the increasing use of digital methods as a mode of analysis still remains somewhat controversial subject within the field of English literary studies (Eve 1). This first section of the paper seeks to illuminate some of the opportunities which the use of digital technologies may bring to the study of English literature.

Firstly, digital methods of analysis, as noted previously, already have a long history in the field. Franco Moretti’s concept of ‘distant reading’ is an early and influential example of this merging of literary analysis and digital methodology (Kopec 332). Distant reading utilises computer programmes to analyse individual texts or extensive corpora, giving the researcher access to a wealth of data such as how many times a specific word occurs in a text which allows for analysis and identification of ‘broader literary trends and patterns’ (Thakre 18). With the use of digital technologies, it becomes possible for researchers to process amounts of material that were previously impossible to get through for even a team of researchers (Eve 9). This arguably allows for new ways to engage more closely with literary texts as it gives researchers ‘a new viewport through which to observe […] narratives’ (Eve 4).

Secondly, data visualisation techniques offer new tools that can aid researchers in communicating their findings as visualisations like word clouds, heat maps, and network graphs can ‘provide intuitive insights into the structure, content, and relationships within literary texts’ (Thakre 19). Visualisation can enhance ‘the understanding of complex literary phenomena’ providing both researchers and laymen access to new perspectives on literature (Thakre 19; Eve 2).
